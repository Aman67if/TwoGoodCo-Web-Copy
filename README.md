'Two Good Co.' üèÜ This website was inspired by an award-winning design from Awwwards, and I meticulously recreated its stunning frontend and animations. 

Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I brought this vision to life, with GSAP and ScrollTrigger for fluid animations and an engaging user experience.

This project was a September milestone for me, showcasing my skills in web development and animation.

‚ö†Ô∏è NOTE : This website Is now only mobile responsive. And now I'm working on it for PC responsiveness too.
